WP Core Monitor is a lightweight tool designed to help advanced WordPress users debug theme and plugin conflicts. The plugin offers two useful functionalities that cannot be found in other debugging tools.

* **Hooks Scanner** that can be used to scan plugins and themes to identify available action and filter hooks for customization and troubleshooting.
* **Redirect Debugger** allowing to trace WordPress-based redirects and pinpoint the exact plugin or theme calling the [wp_redirect()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_redirect/) function.

The plugin **does not need to be activated at all time**. You can enable it just for the debugging process, after which you can either disable in the settings the debug info (displayed in the front-end) or deactivate the plug-in entirely.
